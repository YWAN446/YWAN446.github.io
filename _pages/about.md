I am a Biostatistician and Mathematical Modeler at the Center for Global Safe Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University. I conducted policy-related public health research globally and in the United States. My research focuses primarily on the mathematical and statistical modeling for infectious disease transmission (e.g., COVID-19), multi-pathway microbial exposure assessment, and strategic sampling design for wastewater surveillance (e.g., Typhoid, COVID-19).
