This is a model created with Bandai MG 1/100 Nu Gundam ver Ka model kits in March 2023. The model was assembled and painted, water decals were applied, and the model was finished with flat coat (Mr. Super Clear). The KOSMOS lighting component, which can be controled by phone using bluetooth, were installed to the model. Below are some photos of the model:
